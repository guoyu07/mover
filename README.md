This tool helps you to keep your macOS Desktop clean. It moves files that have not been accessed for seven days to a folder under Documents. That folder is created with a name like 201712 that indicates the month.

So whenever you run this script, it moves files from:

```
~/Desktop
```

To:

```
~/Documents/Drawer/YYYYMM/
```

Hidden files that with names starting with a dot are ignored and will not be touched.
